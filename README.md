<p align="center"><h1>üß† Prompt Library</h1></p>

Welcome to the "Prompt Library" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using ChatGPT!
